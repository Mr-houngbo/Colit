With a new SDK release, the latest version enters the current release status. This applies to Expo Go as it only supports the latest SDK version and previous versions are no longer supported. We recommend using [development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction) for production apps as the backwards compatibility for older SDK versions on EAS services tends to be much longer, but not forever.
If you are looking to install a specific version of Expo Go, visit [expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go). It supports downloads for Android devices/emulators and iOS simulators. However, due to iOS platform restrictions, only the latest version of Expo Go is available for installation on physical iOS devices.

## How to upgrade to the latest SDK version

1

### Upgrade the Expo SDK
Install the new version of the Expo package:
npm
Yarn
pnpm
Bun
Copy

```
-
```


```
npm install expo@^54.0.0
```

Copy

```
-
```


```
yarn add expo@^54.0.0
```

Copy

```
-
```


```
pnpm add expo@^54.0.0
```

Copy

```
-
```


```
bun install expo@^54.0.0
```

Depending on which SDK you're upgrading to, substitute the expo@^54.0.0 with the version range of the Expo SDK version you're targeting. For example, expo@^54.0.0 stands for SDK 54.

```
expo@^54.0.0
```


```
expo@^54.0.0
```

2

### Upgrade dependencies
Upgrade all dependencies to match the installed SDK version. Then run [expo-doctor](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/tools) command to check for common problems.

```
expo-doctor
```

Copy

```
-
```


```
npx expo install --fix
```


```
-
```


```
npx expo-doctor
```

### Update native projects
- If you use [Continuous Native Generation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation): Delete the android and ios directories if you generated them for a previous SDK version in your local project directory. They'll be re-generated next time you run a build, either with npx expo run:ios, npx expo prebuild, or with EAS Build.
- If you don't use Continuous Native Generation: Run npx pod-install if you have an ios directory. Apply any relevant changes from the Native project upgrade helper. Alternatively, you could consider [adopting prebuild](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/adopting-prebuild) for easier upgrades in the future.
[Continuous Native Generation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation)

```
npx expo run:ios
```


```
npx expo prebuild
```

[Continuous Native Generation](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation)

```
npx pod-install
```

### Follow the release notes for any other instructions
Read the [SDK changelogs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough) for the SDK version you are upgrading to. They contain important information about breaking changes, deprecations, and other changes that may affect your app. Refer to the "Upgrading your app" section at the bottom of the release notes page for any additional instructions.

## SDK Changelogs

Each SDK announcement release notes post contains information deprecations, breaking changes, and anything else that might be unique to that particular SDK version. When upgrading, be sure to check these out to make sure you don't miss anything.
